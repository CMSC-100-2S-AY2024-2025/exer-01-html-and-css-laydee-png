Steps on how to create GitHub page:
    1. Clone the remote repository in the local machine and configure Git in the local repo by setting the personal email and username.
    2. Change the visibility of the Git repository to public.
    3. Configure GitHub by selecting which part of branch will be used to hose the site.

Key Takeaways:
    My key takeaway for this exercise is that front-end development is not an easy task. You have to consider the layout and structure for the readablity as well as exert your creativity when creating a webpage.
